# DSP-1
Introductory Digital Signal Processing. 5 files, for 5 labs.

The overal content of the lab deal with essential conecept in digital signal processing; from discerte time signals to the Fast Fourier Transform. 

The content predominately focuses on using algorithimic methods in order to create sequences and to process these sequences. Although, on occasion the use of Matlab functions are used (most of which do not requeire Matlab's DSP-toolbox).
